# Elexis Environment Security Fixes and Hardening Guide

## Summary
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities found and the fixes implemented in the Elexis Environment.

## Implemented Security Fixes

### 1. Added Global Security Headers
**File**: `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/conf/security-headers.conf`
**Fixed**: Missing HSTS, CSP, and other security headers

Added comprehensive security headers including:
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with 1-year duration
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks  
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing
- X-Frame-Options for clickjacking protection
- Referrer-Policy for privacy protection
- Permissions-Policy to disable dangerous browser features

### 2. Implemented Rate Limiting
**Files**: 
- `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/nginx.conf`
- `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/conf/nginx-int.conf`
- `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/conf/nginx-ext.conf`
- `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/conf/elexis-server-ext.conf`

**Fixed**: DoS and brute force attack vectors

Added rate limiting zones:
- General requests: 10 req/s (internal), more restrictive for external
- Authentication endpoints: 5 req/s (internal), 3 req/s (external)  
- API endpoints: 30 req/s with burst handling

### 3. Reduced File Upload Limits
**Files**: 
- `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/nginx.conf` (512M → 100M)
- `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/conf/guacamole*.conf` (512M → 256M)

**Fixed**: Potential DoS through large file uploads

### 4. Enhanced Keycloak Security
**File**: `docker/compose/assets/web/etc/conf/nginx-ext.conf`
**Fixed**: Administrative endpoint exposure

Added blocks for additional sensitive endpoints:
- `/keycloak/auth/management/`
- `/keycloak/auth/subsystem/`  
- Enhanced existing blocks for admin endpoints

### 5. Created Security Documentation
**Files**: 
- `SECURITY_WARNING.md` - Critical security warnings
- `docker/security.env` - Docker security configuration template
- Updated `README.md` with prominent security warnings

**Fixed**: Lack of security awareness and documentation

## Manual Actions Required

### CRITICAL - Disable Demo User
The default `demouser` account with password `demouser` must be disabled:

1. Access Keycloak admin console: `https://yourhost/keycloak/auth/admin/`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Navigate to Users → Find `demouser`
4. Disable or delete the account

### IMPORTANT - Environment Security
1. Change all default passwords in `.env` file
2. Use strong, unique passwords for each service
3. Review and restrict enabled services to minimum required
4. Implement proper SSL certificate management
5. Regular security updates and patches

## Remaining Security Considerations

### High Priority
1. **Container Privilege Review**: Some containers still require elevated privileges (wireguard, code-server)
2. **Database Security**: Ensure database servers are properly secured and access-controlled
3. **Network Segmentation**: Consider additional network isolation between services
4. **Backup Security**: Implement secure backup procedures with encryption

### Medium Priority  
1. **Log Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular container and dependency scanning
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper RBAC within applications
4. **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate renewal and monitoring

### Low Priority
1. **Security Headers Tuning**: Fine-tune CSP policies per application
2. **Rate Limiting Optimization**: Adjust limits based on usage patterns
3. **Error Page Hardening**: Custom error pages to prevent information disclosure

## Testing Security Fixes

To validate the security improvements:

1. **Test Security Headers**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://yourhost/
   # Verify presence of security headers
   ```

2. **Test Rate Limiting**:
   ```bash
   # Test authentication rate limiting
   for i in {1..10}; do curl -w "%{http_code}\n" https://yourhost/keycloak/; done
   ```

3. **Test Blocked Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://yourhost/keycloak/auth/admin/
   # Should return 403 Forbidden
   ```

## Security Monitoring

Recommended monitoring points:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations  
- Access to blocked endpoints
- Large file upload attempts
- SSL certificate expiration

## Compliance Notes

These fixes help with:
- HIPAA compliance for medical data protection
- GDPR privacy requirements
- Industry security best practices
- PCI DSS if payment processing is involved
